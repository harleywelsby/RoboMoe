It's time to get creative with your friday night drinks! To use the bot, use the commands below to set up a 'cabinet' of ingredients,
then use /drink to create a new recipe, complete with an AI-generated name, using the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api">OpenAI API</a>

# Use the following commands to make some drinks:

- /drink - Pour up a drink
- /add - Add an ingredient to the liquor cabinet
- /remove - Remove an ingredient from the liquor cabinet
- /cabinet - See the current ingredients
